# How to Add Your Logo as Favicon

## Option 1: Replace the existing icon.svg (Recommended)

1. Upload your logo image file to: `/Users/VR/Mesa/app/`
2. Name it exactly: `icon.svg` (or `icon.png`, `icon.jpg`, `icon.ico`)
3. Next.js will automatically use it as the favicon

**Supported formats:**
- `icon.svg` - Vector (best quality at any size)
- `icon.png` - Raster (good for complex designs)
- `icon.jpg` - Raster
- `icon.ico` - Traditional favicon format

## Option 2: Use a different filename

If you want to use a different filename (e.g., `logo.svg`):

1. Upload your file to: `/Users/VR/Mesa/app/` with your preferred name
2. Let me know the filename and I'll update the code to reference it

## Current Setup

Right now, the favicon is set to use `app/icon.svg`. If you replace that file with your logo, it will automatically work!

## After Uploading

Once you've uploaded the file:
1. The favicon will update automatically
2. You may need to hard refresh your browser (Cmd+Shift+R) to see the change
3. Let me know if you need help configuring it!
